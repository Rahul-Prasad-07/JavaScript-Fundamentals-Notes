# JavaScript-Notes
## How do browsers execute JavaScript?

- Computers understand everything in binary language, i.e., in the form of zeroes and ones. 

- They do not understand the English alphabets. Saying 'hello' in binary is similar to saying 01001000 011, followed by a dozen zeroes and ones.

- So, any instruction you give has to be first converted to the binary form. Once this is done, the computer can understand and process the instructions. 

- It is extremely tough for humans to provide instructions in the form of zeroes and ones. 
- This is where programming languages such as JavaScript get involved.

- We give instructions to the computer in these programming languages (that we understand quite well), and they are converted to the machine language (that is understood well by computers) using translators.

- Out of the different types of translators, we will discuss only two. These are as follows: compilers and interpreters.

- An interpreter processes each line in the program one by one, and if an error is encountered on any line, it is reported immediately. On the other hand, a compiler processes the entire program at once, and at the end, it reports all the errors (if any) in the entire program.

- Please note that JavaScript is interpreted and not compiled. However, compilers are also available for JavaScript.
