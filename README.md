##Welcome to JavaScript Fundamentals 👋
We're so excited to finally release this long-awaited content to the world. This course used to be worth $100! Alchemy and ChainShot teamed up to make this JS crash course completely free in an effort to teach thousands of devs the fundamentals of coding via the JavaScript programming language.

Best Practices to Maximize the Value of JS Fundamentals 🚀
Here’s a quick list of recommendations to maximize your AU student experience:

1. Community, Community, Community! 🏘
   You are not expected to tackle all this content alone! Get involved, be active, reach out if you need help! Find your niche, find like-minded folks... then build cool shit with them - this is the way.

"The best way to learn is by teaching.” If you see others who are stuck, help them out! This will not only get you street cred within the AU community but also, will help you solidify your own understanding of these concepts. Show us what you got!

Make sure to join the AU Discord to connect and work together with peers!

2. Choose Your Own Pace 🏃‍♂️
   AU is releasing most of its content for asynchronous learning, meaning, the course is completed at the pace that you choose. However, AU instructors will be hosting weekly town halls and community get-togethers in the AU Discord. These will mainly be geared towards the Ethereum Developer Bootcamp, but nonetheless, JS discussions will surely happen frequently.

Note: for early access, we will be releasing the content on a week-by-week basis!

3. You Get Out What You Put In ♻️
   Many folks ask us what is to be expected once they actually complete the content. The truth is, it really depends on the student. Generally, those that invest time for true learning and community networking, get out 2x to 10x the value.

4. LEARN! 📚
   Be excited to learn! Go into rabbit holes. Adopt the student mindset. Read and research things that make you passionate. These technologies can change the world one day, so learn with excitement and patience.

5. If You Get Stuck... 🚫
   ... that is a normal part of process! Our suggestion whenever you run into any issues is always a set flow:

DYOR - Do Your Own Research! Google around, see you if can find any similar issues to yours and debug that way.
We are not suggesting this first because we do not want to help you (of course we do!), rather, true developers are best at unblocking themselves and finding the resources they need dynamically. DYOR is possibly the #1 skill of all developers, web3 or not. So, get good at DYOR and you will get good at development!

If you don't find anything with DYOR...

Look to the AU Discord channels and ask the community for help! Remember: thousands of students are taking these courses concurrently. The instructors will always look to help, but since instructors are much fewer, your second point of contact should be the broader AU community.
6. Give Us Feedback 👀
   Remember, this is a beta release (aka: Early Access)! We've worked really hard to get the content and website in really good shape but it is inevitable some folks will encounter bugs here and there. If you ever run into any bug or issue, make sure to select the Give us feedback! button in your AU Dashboard. You will then be able to specify the nature of the bug and report it. We so appreciate your help, Early Access community, and patience as we craft this to be the greatest intro course in the world!

Content Format 📚
Alchemy University content contains a mix of instructional videos, research articles, guides, tutorials and coding challenges.

JavaScript Fundamentals is 3 weeks worth of content. Each day covers a new topic and the intention is for the concepts to slowly but surely build up. The content within each week is typically separated into a variety of practice problems and lots of coding challenges!

For coding challenges, you will also be working in the proprietary Alchemy IDE, a fully in-browser experience meant to get you up and running with coding JS, Solidity and more without the need for any environment setup.

What Can I Do After The Course? 💯
The Ethereum Developer Bootcamp calls you! 📳 Lots of JS used there!
